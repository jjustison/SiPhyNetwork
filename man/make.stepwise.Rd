\title{Make a stepwise decay function}
\usage{
make.stepwise(probs, distances)
}
\arguments{
\item{probs}{Vector of dimension k, where k is the number of different probabilities of success. An individual time between (distances[i-1],distances[i]] has probability of success prob[i]}

\item{distances}{Vector of k, containing the end of each interval where success probabilities shift. The first interval where success is prob[1] is [0,distances[1]]. For all i>1, the probability of success is prob[i] over the interval (distance[i-1],distances[i]].}
}
\value{
An stepwise decay function
}
\description{
Create a stepwise decay function for genetic distance of two taxa and the probability of success of a hybridization event
