\title{Determine whether a network is tree-based}
\usage{
isTreeBased(net)
}
\arguments{
\item{net}{A phylogenetic network of class \code{evonet}.}
}
\value{
A logical that is \code{TRUE} if the network is tree-based
}
\description{
This function determines whether a network is tree-based
}
\details{
A phylogenetic network is said to be tree-based if it can be constructed with a base tree that has additional linking arcs added. See jetten 2016 Corollary 2.11 for the algorithm used to determine whether the network is tree-based

\examples{
net<- read.net(text= "((A:7,((B:2,C:2):3)#H1:2::0.6):3,(D:6,#H1:1::0.4):4);")
isTreeBased(net) ##returns TRUE
