# SiPhyNetwork

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of SiPhyNetwork is to generate Phylogenetic networks in a
process-based manner. SiPhyNetwork considers a birth-death-hybridization
proccess for simulating Networks. We allow for hybridization to
be lineage generative, lineage degenerative, and lineage neutral.
