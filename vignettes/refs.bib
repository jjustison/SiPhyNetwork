  abstract = {{A wide range of evolutionary models for species-level (and higher) diversification have been developed. These models can be used to test evolutionary hypotheses and provide comparisons with phylogenetic trees constructed from real data. To carry out these tests and comparisons, it is often necessary to sample, or simulate, trees from the evolutionary models. Sampling trees from these models is more complicated than it may appear at first glance, necessitating careful consideration and mathematical rigor. Seemingly straightforward sampling methods may produce trees that have systematically biased shapes or branch lengths. This is particularly problematic as there is no simple method for determining whether the sampled trees are appropriate. In this paper, we show why a commonly used simple sampling approach (SSA)—simulating trees forward in time until n species are first reached—should only be applied to the simplest pure birth model, the Yule model. We provide an alternative general sampling approach (GSA) that can be applied to most other models. Furthermore, we introduce the constant-rate birth–death model sampling approach, which samples trees very efficiently from a widely used class of models. We explore the bias produced by SSA and identify situations in which this bias is particularly pronounced. We show that using SSA can lead to erroneous conclusions: When using the inappropriate SSA, the variance of a gradually evolving trait does not correlate with the age of the tree; when the correct GSA is used, the trait variance correlates with tree age. The algorithms presented here are available in the Perl Bio::Phylo package, as a stand-alone program TreeSample, and in the R TreeSim package.}},

  abstract = {Abstract Understanding macroevolutionary processes using phylogenetic trees is a challenging and complex process that draws on mathematics, computer science and biology. Given the development of complex mathematical models and the growing computational processing power, simulation tools are becoming increasingly popular. In order to simulate phylogenetic trees, most evolutionary biologists are forced to build their own algorithms or use existing tools built on different platforms and/or as standalone programmes. The absence of a simulation tool accommodating for user-chosen model specifications limits, amongst others, model testing and pipelining with approximate Bayesian computation methods or other subsequent statistical analysis. We introduce “TreeSimGM,” an r-package simulation tool for phylogenetic trees under a general Bellman and Harris model. This package allows the user to specify any desired probability distribution for the waiting times until speciation and extinction (e.g. age-dependent speciation/extinction). Upon speciation, the user can specify whether one descendant species corresponds to the ancestor species inheriting its age or whether both descendant species are new species of age 0. Moreover, it is possible to scale the waiting time to speciation/extinction for newly formed species. Thus, “TreeSimGM” not only allows the user to simulate stochastic phylogenetic trees assuming several popular existing models, such as the Yule model, the constant-rate birth–death model, and proportional to distinguishable arrangement models, but it also allows the user to formulate new models for exploration. A short explanation of the supported models and a few examples of how to use our package are presented here. As an r-package, “TreeSimGM” allows flexible and powerful stochastic phylogenetic tree simulations. Moreover, it facilitates the pipelining of outputs or inputs with other functions in r. “TreeSimGM” contributes to the tools available to the r community in the fields of ecology and evolution, is freely available under the GPL-2 licence and can be downloaded at https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/TreeSimGM.},

Both the time-dependent and the diversity-dependent birth–death process can produce the same observed patterns of diversity over time. To develop and test new models describing the macro-evolutionary process of diversification, generic and fast algorithms to simulate under these models are necessary. Simulations are not only important for testing and developing models but play an influential role in the assessment of model fit.Results: In the present article, I consider as the model a global time-dependent birth–death process where each species has the same rates but rates may vary over time. For this model, I derive the likelihood of the speciation times from a reconstructed phylogenetic tree and show that each speciation event is independent and identically distributed. This fact can be used to simulate efficiently reconstructed phylogenetic trees when conditioning on the number of species, the time of the process or both. I show the usability of the simulation by approximating the posterior predictive distribution of a birth–death process with decreasing diversification rates applied on a published bird phylogeny (family Cettiidae).Availability: The methods described in this manuscript are implemented in the R package TESS, available from the repository CRAN (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/TESS/).Contact:hoehna@math.su.seSupplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}},

The simulation approach for case (2) can also be used to simulate under more general models with fixed events after the origin. I use the developed simulation tools for showing that a mass extinction event cannot be distinguished from a model with constant speciation and extinction rates interrupted by a phase of stasis based on trees consisting of only extant species. However, once we distinguish between mass extinction and period of stasis based on paleontological data, fast simulations of trees with a fixed number of species allow inference of speciation and extinction rates using approximate Bayesian computation and allow for robustness analysis once maximum likelihood parameter estimations are available.}},

In microbes, lateral gene transfer is the dominant process that spoils strictly tree-like phylogenies, but in multicellular eukaryotes hybridization and introgression among related species is probably more important. Because many species, including the ancestors of ancient major lineages, seem to evolve rapidly in adaptive radiations, some sexual compatibility may exist among them. Introgression and reticulation can thereby affect all parts of the tree of life, not just the recent species at the tips. Our understanding of adaptive evolution, speciation, phylogenetics, and comparative biology must adapt to these mostly recent findings. Introgression has important practical implications as well, not least for the management of genetically modified organisms in pest and disease control.},

At the time of its release, the main functionalities in PhyloNet consisted of measures for comparing network topologies and a single heuristic for reconciling gene trees with a species tree. Since then, PhyloNet has grown significantly. The software package now includes a wide array of methods for inferring phylogenetic networks from data sets of unlinked loci while accounting for both reticulation (e.g., hybridization) and incomplete lineage sorting. In particular, PhyloNet now allows for maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian inference of phylogenetic networks from gene tree estimates. Furthermore, Bayesian inference directly from sequence data (sequence alignments or biallelic markers) is implemented. Maximum parsimony is based on an extension of the “minimizing deep coalescences” criterion to phylogenetic networks, whereas maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference are based on the multispecies network coalescent. All methods allow for multiple individuals per species. As computing the likelihood of a phylogenetic network is computationally hard, PhyloNet allows for evaluation and inference of networks using a pseudolikelihood measure. PhyloNet summarizes the results of the various analyzes and generates phylogenetic networks in the extended Newick format that is readily viewable by existing visualization software.}},

Despite its importance, BTC networks, as mathematical objects, are not yet fully understood. In this paper we introduce two operations (reduction and augmentation) on the set of BTC networks that generalize well known operations on phylogenetic trees, and show how they can be used to analyze and synthesize any BTC network. Apart from the mathematical formulation of the problem, we exhibit how these operations can be used in biological applications to add a new sequence to a given BTC network. This can be useful, for instance, to update the network without redoing the whole search, or in a phylogenetic placement perspective. We also obtain a recursive formula for a bound on the number of such networks. We have implemented the algorithms in this paper, made them available on a public repository, and used this implementation to perform some computational simulations.},
